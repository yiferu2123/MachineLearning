# Statistical Process Control (SPC) Lab

This notebook demonstrates the creation of an **X-bar Control Chart** for monitoring process variations over time.

## 📊 Overview
-   **File**: `SPC_Control_Chart_Lab.ipynb`
-   **Method**: Calculate mean (X-bar), Upper Control Limit (UCL), and Lower Control Limit (LCL).
-   **Purpose**: Identify if a process is stable or out of control based on sample data.

## 🛠 Libraries Used
-   `numpy`: Numerical operations
-   `matplotlib`: Plotting control charts

## 📈 Charts
-   **Sample Measurements**: Random data points representing process measurements (e.g., thickness, weight).
-   **Control Limits**: Horizontal lines for UCL and LCL (typically ±3 sigma).
-   **Process Mean**: The central line (X-bar).

---
**Note**: This is a laboratory exercise focusing on the mechanics of building a control chart.
